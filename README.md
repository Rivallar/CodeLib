# CodeLib

Personal knowledge storage realized as Django app.
This is a way to <b>keep everything have been learned at one place</b>. It allows to make and <b>organize new
notes the way you want</b> and access them anytime from any device.

### :+1:Advantages:

- it is in the Internet (independent of your working laptop/home PC)
- all in one place (no more numerous files for different disciplines)
- it uses markdown - make your notes as beautiful and informative as you want,
[make links](https://github.com/Rivallar/CodeLib/edit/main/README.md) between them and to external resourses, keep `code examples`, how-to-do instructions
or big chunks of theory:books:. Whatever suits you most!
- flexible structure - organize your note pages in sub-themes, themes and disciplines
- convenient navigation and search:mag_right:

### :gear: How to run:

You need a virtual environment with everything in requirements.txt installed and 
additional security.py file with your secret key and database settings.  
It can use MySQL or PostgreSQL. But postgres is better because of its full text search 
engine implemented (ranking, stemming and highlighting results).<br>
There are also :whale: docker-compose files to deploy it swiftly.:whale2:

### :warning:Disclaimer

This app is mvp-product and still is under development. I did it fast for my own purposes 
and improve it regularly.<br>
It has no user-registration system (you have to manage users from admin-site) and designed
for one-person usage (maybe I shall fix it later). Also I did not waste a lot of time on its
visual design.<br>
But it does what it is designed to do and that`s fine for me!
